					Project Report

Introduction:
Our Project is a game based on javascript and html canvas,It is made with the help of the canvas file made by zense.

Program Description:
Its a fun game in which a nucleus is protected by an arc which can be controlled by the user using either the mouse pointer or the left and right keys on the keyboard.
Absorbing  a red ball shrinks the nucleus while absorbing a green ball increases the size of the nucleus.

Steps involved:
1)It involves the use of functions and ctx for rendering a gradient.
2)It also allows involves usage of classes and list of objects to render multiple enemies and energie balls.
3)It has multiple functions which detects collisions between the balls ,the arc and the nucleus.

Conclusion:
It allowed us to get a deeper understanding of javascript and canvas , the time limit also showed us how to handle tough bu
gs in the code and also allowed  us to take better decisions for the final Program.
